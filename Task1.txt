🧩 Task 1: Develop a basic text-based game

🧩 Objective: Implement a simple game using
   conditional statements for game logic.

✅ Step 1: Choose a Game Type

- We will develop a Number Guessing Game — a great way to practice using conditional statements effectively.

✅Step 2: Define the Game Rules and Logic

- Game Title: Number Guessing Game

📜 Rules:

    - The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.

    - The player has 3 attempts to guess the number.

    - After each guess, the program provides feedback:

     "Too high"

     "Too low"

     "Correct!"

    - If the player does not guess correctly within 3 tries, the game ends with the correct answer.

✅ Step 3: Use Conditional Statements for Game Flow

Here's a complete Python implementation of the game:

Python:

import random

def guessing_game():
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    attempts_left = 3

    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")
    print("You have 3 attempts to guess it correctly.\n")

    while attempts_left > 0:
        guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))

        if guess == number_to_guess:
            print("🎉 Correct! You guessed the number!")
            break
        elif guess < number_to_guess:
            print("Too low.")
        else:
            print("Too high.")

        attempts_left -= 1
        print(f"Attempts remaining: {attempts_left}\n")

    if attempts_left == 0:
        print(f"Game Over! The correct number was {number_to_guess}.")

# Run the game
guessing_game()

output:

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
You have 3 attempts to guess it correctly.

Enter your guess: 1
Too low.
Attempts remaining: 2

Enter your guess: 4
Too low.
Attempts remaining: 1

Enter your guess: 8
Too low.
Attempts remaining: 0

Game Over! The correct number was 9.

✅ Step 4: Test and Debug

   Test the program with:

 - A correct guess on the first, second, or third attempt.

 - All incorrect guesses.

 - Edge values (like guessing 1 or 10).

 - Invalid inputs (e.g., letters or special characters).
